# ESLint config

This modules provides an ESLint configuration to be used with TypeScript
according to my personal preferences.

## Usage

Add `eslint` and `@crycode/eslint-config` to your devDependencies:

```shell
npm install --save-dev eslint @crycode/eslint-config
```

Add a file named `.eslintrc.js` to your project root directory:

```js
module.exports = {
  extends: [
    '@crycode/eslint-config'
  ],
  parserOptions: {
    project: [
      './tsconfig.json',
    ],
  },
};
```

If you habe multiple tsconfig files, add them all to `project` like this:

```js
module.exports = {
  extends: [
    '@crycode/eslint-config'
  ],
  parserOptions: {
    project: [
      './tsconfig.backend.json',
      './tsconfig.frontend.json',
    ],
  },
};
```
